3. Product details
- Register products of interest through the heart button
- In the frontend, when a button is clicked, the state is immediately reversed from the current state through mutate in useSWR and the UI is immediately reflected (non-red when heart is active, active when inactive)
- When the button is clicked, the interface is changed immediately and at the same time notified that the backend is toggled through useMutation.

4. Chat with product sellers via chat
- When Talk to seller button is clicked, a chatRoom is created in the backend based on the sellerId and the user (clicked user) in the session.
- If the chat room is created normally, the backend transmits ok: true through res.json and the chatRoomId in the data. When ok: true is confirmed using useEffect in the frontend, move to the created chat room (set the path through chatRoomId in data)
